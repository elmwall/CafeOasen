# CafeOasen


Welcome to the repository of my fictive café website!

[View the café website in its current form](https://elmwall.github.io/CafeOasen/), currently in Swedish only. The homepage and menu page have baisc functionality, while the rest are still under construction.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to challenge and demonstrate my skills in HTML and CSS, as well as my ability to plan the design, layout, and code for developing a website. 

The content itself was not the main focus of the exercise. Everything, including text and images, are completely fictional.

## Goals

The initial goal is to apply my current knowledge with HTML and CSS to create the basic appearance and functionality of the page to create a responsive design that works on various screen sizes. Later I will apply further functionality with Javascript.

## Acknowledgements

The café concept as a skill developing project was given to me by [VickyVariety](https://github.com/VickyVariety), who also provided most text and images as well as guidance. Check out her stuff!
