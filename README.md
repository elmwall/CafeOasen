# CafeOasen

'''
Welcome to the repository of my fictive café website!
'''

[View the café website in its current form.](https://elmwall.github.io/CafeOasen/), currently in Swedish only. The homepage and menu page have baisc functionality, while the rest are still under construction.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my skill in HTML and CSS, as well as my ability to plan the design, layout, and coding in developing a website. 

## Goals

The initial goal is to apply my current knowledge with HTML and CSS to create the basic appearance and functionality of the page to create a responsive design that works on various screen sizes. Later I will apply further functionality with Javascript.
